  <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I moved from my older, cumbersome emacs setup to a package.el based one. I currently use an Emacs 24.3&nbsp;
    <a href="http://emacsformacosx.com/">build
    </a> for Mac OS X (which comes with package.el). Its cleaner -
    <br />
    <br />
    <ol style="text-align: left;">
      <li>I just list the packages I need in my init file - no submodules business
      </li>
      <li>Run through the list to find if a package is installed or not. If not, download and install package from elpa/melpa/marmalade
      </li>
      <li>For now, an added manual step when removing a package is to delete related folder from the /elpa/ directory
      </li>
    </ol>
    <div>Here's a gist which explains (I maintain this setup at <a href="https://github.com/rnjn/dotemacs/">github</a>)
