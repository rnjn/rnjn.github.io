      <p>Hullo there!</p>
<p>My name is Ranjan, you may find my work bio <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rnjns/">here</a>. I am currently on a break from active employment and spending time with kids, reading, roaming around and generally not doing much of anything. During this break, I am helping and coaching some founders and engineering leaders who have found pmf and are aspiring to scale their engineering teams.</p>
<h3 id="more-about-me">More about me</h3>
<p>Till recently, I managed engineering for an Indian edTech company called Vedantu. Before that, I worked at an Indonesian company called gojek (now GoTo), building a much loved app that tries to remove life&rsquo;s daily frictions. Chances are, if you have been to Indonesia in the last 4-5 years, I have caused some distress to you because of one of the many mistakes I&rsquo;ve made. I have been a software developer since 2002, and prior to gojek, I worked for about a decade at ThoughtWorks, a software consultancy firm and home to some of my favourite people.</p>
<p>If you would like to interact with me -</p>
<ul>
<li>on Twitter, you may find me babbling about all kinds of topics (but not politics, I put that side of me away when online). My alias there is <a href="https://twitter.com/rnjn">@rnjn</a></li>
<li>you can also email me, <code>r</code> at <code>rnjn.in</code></li>
<li>I update my reading list infrequently on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/235359-ranjan">Goodreads</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I prefer email for async conversations over most other channels where there are inherent expectations to get back as soon as its possible. This is not because I am busy, I just prefer a bit of think time on most topics.</p>
<p>I like writing code, reading books, all kinds, and I love watching the telly, and movies and sports. I like cooking and eating good food, and try (right now, only to myself) to find common things between cooking and software development. I also like travelling, music and all things shiny and well made. I like a lot of things, dislike very few, and that&rsquo;s how I would like to see the world, a slight tilt to the positive is enough to keep everyone hopeful!</p>
