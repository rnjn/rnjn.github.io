      <p>Hullo there!</p>
<p>My name is Ranjan, I come from the wonderful city of Jabalpur, I moved to Bangalore in 2002 where I live now with my wife Gouri and 2 daughters - Gayatri and Mili, who are both equal parts guilty and innocent. I hope to see them grow up healthy and kind.</p>
<p>Currently, I work for an Indonesian company called gojek, building a much loved app that tries to remove life&rsquo;s daily frictions. Chances are, if you have been to Indonesia in the last 4-5 years, I have caused some distress to you because of one of the many mistakes I&rsquo;ve made. I have been a software developer since 2002, and prior to gojek, I worked for a couple of days short of 10 years at ThoughtWorks, a software consultancy firm.</p>
<p>If you would like to interact with me -</p>
<ul>
<li>on Twitter, you may find me babbling about all kinds of topics (but not politics, I put that side of me away when online). My alias there is <a href="https://twitter.com/rnjn">@rnjn</a></li>
<li>you can also email me, same handle as above, at hey.com.</li>
<li>I very rarely update or visit other sites like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rnjns/">LinkedIn</a></li>
<li>You should not be on Facebook</li>
<li>I update my reading infrequently on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/235359-ranjan">Goodreads</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I prefer email for async conversations over most other channels where there are inherent expectations to get back as soon as its possible. This is not because I am busy, I just prefer a bit of think time on most topics.</p>
<p>I like writing code, reading books, all kinds, and I love watching the telly, and movies and sports. I like cooking and eating good food, and try (right now, only to myself) to find common things between cooking and software development. I also like travelling, music and all things shiny and well made. I like a lot of things, dislike very few, and that&rsquo;s how I would like to see the world, a slight tilt to the positive is enough to keep everyone hopeful!</p>
