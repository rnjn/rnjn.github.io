Iterative improvement is the basis of most modern project management principles (agile/xp/scrum..). It follows the Scientific Method. The steps are simple and intuitive, indeed they follow how we learn most things - by trying and failing and trying again. So in case you have a system that you want to improve -  Experiment - formalise and execute the change you expect to make in the system Observe - Observe the effect(s) of said change Course Correct - From these observations, find out if changes in the experiments are needed, and then make them.</description>
