      <blockquote>
<p>This is WIP, and I hope to keep adding to this document.</p></blockquote>
<p>Engineering management practices have been steadily evolving over decades. Back in the 00&rsquo;s when I started working, we were quite sure that agile teams were best placed to deliver software. It has been known for a long time that for smaller teams, process and management comes in the way of productivity and therefore for teams smaller than 10-12 engineers, smarter minds have always kept processes lightweight and focused on rigorous software engineering practices, like Continuous Delivery, TDD, Pair programming and so on. But as teams grow, things get harder.</p>
<p>One can plot delivery practices of teams from complete absence of a well defined process (often called SDLC) to some of the most rigid work processes defined by mankind, where engineers need signatures in triplicate before deploying anything to production. As team sizes grow, one could also plot organisations moving from the former towards the latter end of the spectrum; evidently this is also the natural order of things, for example style of government, education and many other well developed areas conclude to a central entity that dictates how the sub-entities behave to ever increasing detail.</p>
<p>The downside of having a rigid, by the book process is that it takes the agency away from a team to tailor how they work based on what they are working on, and the agency to innovate. Emperically speaking, the best software engineers and managers try to avoid working in such environments, and this leads to a vicious cycle of even more process as the quality of team degrades. Very few organisations can stay small and scale their businesses up, and therefore,</p>
